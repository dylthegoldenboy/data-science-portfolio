# data science & communication portfolio. — dylen foster.

Hi! I’m a college student majoring in Professional Writing with minors in Communications and Political Science.  
I’m fascinated by how data can tell stories, shape public understanding, and reveal trends behind the numbers.  

This portfolio collects my projects exploring data analysis, visualization, and storytelling, which combines my interests in communication, policy, and analytics.
